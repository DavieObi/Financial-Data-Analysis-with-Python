# Contributing to Financial Data Analysis with Python

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Financial Data Analysis with Python** project!  
This repository aims to provide hands‑on open‑source tools and workflows for analysing financial data (time series, risk‑return, correlation, portfolio construction, etc.) using Python. Whether you’re a beginner exploring finance through code or an experienced data scientist, your contributions are very welcome.

## 🏆 How You Can Contribute

- **Data Enhancements**: Add new financial datasets (stocks, bonds, commodities, macro‑data), extend existing series, improve cleaning or preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers, resampling).  
- **Model & Analysis Improvements**: Explore new techniques (time‑series models, machine learning, portfolio optimisations), improve feature engineering, model interpretability or comparison of methods.  
- **Visualisations & Dashboards**: Create compelling charts, interactive dashboards, heatmaps of correlations, rolling window analyses, risk‑return scatter plots, portfolio simulations and performance metrics.  
- **Documentation & Tutorials**: Improve the README, add step‑by‑step guides, usage examples, explain key financial metrics, provide beginner‑friendly notebooks or walkthroughs.  
- **Testing & Reproducibility**: Ensure analysis pipelines run end‑to‑end, include example notebooks/scripts, add tests or reproducible workflows.
